    <h1>Making Sense of Our Money System</h1>
        <p>Venmo is responsible for other people&#39;s money, so it is crucial that people understand how
            money operates within the Venmo ecosystem. Venmo is comprised of three different payment
            methods: bank accounts, debit/credit cards and Venmo balances. Depending on the scenario,
            there are different rules that apply to how money movement works. At a high level, money
            moves instantly on Venmo and transactions are free, unless you use a credit card or a debit
            card from a smaller bank.
        </p>
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
            There are many nuances with Venmoâ€™s payment methods relating to fees, timing, transferring
            to banks and type of payments (i.e. paying people or paying merchants). Our most frequent
            support cases come from issues related to our money system. In order to properly scope this
            project and not try to tackle a bunch of problems at once, we decided to focus on one task:
            make it easier to send and receive money on Venmo by simplifying the way one adds and
            manages banks and cards.
