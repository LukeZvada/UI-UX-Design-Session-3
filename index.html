    <h1>Making Sense of Our Money System</h1>
        <p>Venmo is responsible for other people&#39;s money, so it is crucial that people understand how
            money operates within the Venmo ecosystem. Venmo is comprised of three different payment
            methods: bank accounts, debit/credit cards and Venmo balances. Depending on the scenario,
            there are different rules that apply to how money movement works. At a high level, money
            moves instantly on Venmo and transactions are free, unless you use a credit card or a debit
            card from a smaller bank.
        </p>
    <h1>The Problem</h1>
        <p>
            There are many nuances with Venmo’s payment methods relating to fees, timing, transferring
            to banks and type of payments (i.e. paying people or paying merchants). Our most frequent
            support cases come from issues related to our money system. In order to properly scope this
            project and not try to tackle a bunch of problems at once, we decided to focus on one task:
            make it easier to send and receive money on Venmo by simplifying the way one adds and
            manages banks and cards.
        </p>
    <h1>Process</h1>
        <p>
            We used an adaptation of Google Ventures <a href="https://library.gv.com/the-product-design-sprint-understand-day-1-e164f76e69cf#.7qju80cms">product design sprint</a>. This included phases for
            understanding the problem, diverging on solutions, deciding on solutions, prototyping and user
            testing. The project team consisted of an engineer, product manager and product designer. This
            was an accelerated project with the majority of the work completed within two weeks. There
            was a huge time constraint to ship the project because it directly affected another significant
            project that already had a firm deadline to ship.
        </p>
    <h3>Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            After we were confident that everyone on the project team fully understood the problem that
            we were trying to solve, we created a user story (created based on our research and
            knowledge) that would guide the project. Then we moved on to Phase 2, “Exploration”. Phase 2
            of the sprint began with a lot of white boarding and sketching. We aimed to generate as many
            ideas as possible, while keeping in mind the constraints that we defined during Phase 1.
            Below are sketches of ideas that came out during one session of Phase 2. Our sketches were
            very rough; it was really about brainstorming and not getting attached to a single idea.
        </p>

        <p>
            We took all of the ideas generated during Phase 2 and had mini-critiques on each of them.
            During Phase 3, we decided on which ideas to move forward with (i.e. prototype and user test)
            and which ones to discard.
        </p>
    <h3>Prototyping and User Testing</h3>
        <p>
            We are big proponents of making quick prototypes and getting it in front of people so that we
            can validate/test our ideas. For this project, I used a combination of Pixate and Invision to
            prototype full flows of our concepts and interactions. Building quick prototypes allowed us to
            get a better idea of how confident we were with a given solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below is an example of a prototype that we used during a user testing session. The user tests
            helped us identify three things: what we’re confident works, what we’re somewhat confident
            works and what we’re unsure of. Identifying “confidence levels” allowed us to recognize what
            needed more work.
        </p>
        <!-- image -->
        <p>
            After a round of testing, we found that people were having the most trouble understanding (i)
            the difference between a bank account and a card, and (ii) how Venmo balance works. In order
            to solve (i), we did more research and developed a ranking of what people tended to look for
            when identifying a card visually:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Color and appearance of card (Diagonal blue gradient)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Product brand/name (Chase Sapphire Preferred)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Type of card (Debit)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Issuing Bank (Chase)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Network (Visa)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Last 4 (••1234)
                    </li>

                </ol>
            <p>
                See below for an example of how we iterated on the visuals of this concept to help people
                understand the difference between a bank account and a card. (I understand that the 2nd
                iteration doesn&#39;t completely follow the ranked list above. This decision was made because of
                constraints at that time. This will be improved during a later phase of this project.)
            </p>
            <!-- image -->
            <p>
                The 2nd iteration worked a lot better because the card was shaped like a card, and the bank
                was not. Also, people immediately saw the word “Debit” or “Credit” on the card image, and
                that helped people correctly associate the image with a card instead of a bank.
            </p>
        <h3>Building It</h3>
        <p>
            A dozen prototypes later, we finally had something that we felt confident about. At this point, it
            was time to polish UI elements and layouts. Also, because of the time constraint, we had to
            make some tradeoffs in order to hit the deadline. This meant making hard decisions to define
            what was required for the MVP.
